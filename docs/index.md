# Welcome to the S.P.A.N.N.E.R.S.-Plugin-Documentation!

<img style="float: right;" src="img/logo.png" width="200">

We provide a possibility to connect the (open-source) geographic information system [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) with the open graph drawing framework [OGDF](https://ogdf.uos.de/). Our plugin is released under the GNU General Public License ([GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)).

Graph algorithm engineers can embed new graph algorithms in the OGDF and test them on real life instances extracted from map data. QGIS enthusiasts can also browse through a range of efficient algorithms already provided in the OGDF and perform various tasks with them.

With our plugin, you can also perform customisable experiments and automatically visualise the results in a scientific manner.
If you want to use the S.P.A.N.N.E.R.S.-Plugin you can either enjoy the easy installation process with our docker image or you can follow our installation guide by manually installing the individual components.  
We hope that soon, our plugin will also be accepted as an official QGIS Python Plugin and therefore will be available at the [QGIS Python Plugins Repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/), too.

When you're all set, you can start with the [Beginner's Guide](ui.md). Later on, you can also check out our guide for [Advanced Applications](handlers.md).

Good luck and have fun! üòè
